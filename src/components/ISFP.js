const ISFP = `
<p><strong>People with the ISFP personality type (Adventurers)</strong> are true artists – although not necessarily in the conventional sense. For these types, life itself is a canvas for self-expression. From what they wear to how they spend their free time, they act in ways that vividly reflect who they are as unique individuals. With their exploratory spirit and their ability to find joy in everyday life, ISFPs can be among the most interesting people you’ll ever meet.</p>
<h2>ISFP Strengths</h2>
<p><strong>Charming</strong> – People with the ISFP personality type (Adventurers) are relaxed and warm, and their “live and let live” attitude naturally makes them likable and popular.</p>
<p><strong>Sensitive to Others</strong> – ISFPs easily relate to others’ emotions, helping them establish harmony and goodwill and minimize conflict. Many people with this personality type are even able to perceive others’ emotions just by listening to their voices.</p>
<p><strong>Kind and Encouraging</strong> – These individuals possess an innate kindness and fairness that fuels their understanding and empathy toward others and often helps them to create a safe space for others to express their thoughts and feelings. They generally adopt an encouraging disposition, always ready to cheer others on in the pursuit of their passions.</p>
<p><strong>Imaginative</strong> – ISFPs use creativity and insight to craft bold ideas that speak to people’s hearts. While it’s hard to explain this quality on a resume, their vivid imagination and exploratory spirit help people with this personality type in unexpected ways.</p>
<p><strong>Passionate</strong> – Beneath their quiet shyness beats an intensely feeling heart. When these personalities are caught up in something exciting and interesting, they can leave everything else in the dust.</p>
<h2>ISFP Weaknesses</h2>
<p><strong>Difficulty with Structure</strong> – Freedom of expression is often ISFP personalities’ top priority. Anything that interferes with that, like traditions and hard rules, creates a sense of oppression. This can make more rigidly structured contexts a challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Unpredictable</strong> – ISFPs dislike long-term commitments and plans. The tendency to actively avoid planning for the future can cause strain in their romantic relationships and financial hardship later in life.</p>
<p><strong>Easily Stressed</strong> – People with the ISFP personality type live in the present, full of emotion. When situations get out of control, they can shut down, losing their characteristic charm and creativity in favor of gnashing teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty with Technical Problem-Solving</strong> – ISFPs are not the type to build, repair, or try a hands-on approach when faced with technical issues. Their preference for observation over direct, practical involvement often holds them back from dealing effectively with mechanical or technical problem-solving.</p>
<p><strong>Fluctuating Self-Esteem</strong> – It’s demanded that skills be quantified, but that’s hard to do with ISFP personalities’ strengths of sensitivity and exploration. Their efforts are too often dismissed, a hurtful and damaging blow, especially early in life. These individuals can start to believe the naysayers without strong support.</p>
